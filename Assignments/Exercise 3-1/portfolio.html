        <h1>Self Introduction</h1>
        <p>A 3rd year student from KMIT, of CSE branch. I am an aspiring Cybersecurity expert and Cloud engineer, with a hint of that childhood game dev promises sprinked. I have worked on various AI/ML projects, particulary concering Deep Learning and GenAI. Well versed in Python and intermediate in Java development. Really interested in working on low level dev (Rust and C) .I have various other non-technical skills such as Graphoc Design, Photoshop, Video Editing and content creation. To top this off, I'm also an aspiring music producer with a good experience in FL Studio. Watch out for mundane and random facts, as I enjoy literature and read a lot about History of the world. I have other soft skills such as communication and clarity in language and expression.</p>

    <section id="projects"  class="container my-5">
        <div class="row">
        <h3>CySentry</h3>
        <p>A Desktop application to detect if system is compromised or not, with the help of AI/ML methods. Detection
            of malware in PE files and Network packets with the help of Ensemble classifiers and Neural Networks. The
            LLM trained on Ember Dataset provides in depth explanation for the prediction of models with Robust GUI</p>

        <h3>TOYAM</h3>
        <p>An Arduino powered Device with LED and Wi-fi Module, equipped with pH level and hardness detection
            meter to determine if the water is pure and safe to drink or not. A Wi-Fi module with SMTP to transfer details
            of the location where impure water is found.</p>
        
        <h3>CyberGuard 360</h3>
        <h4>FedDrift Eager</h4>
        <p>Worked on Federated learning under distributed environment and how models can have their weight updated in a distibuted server-client architecture</p>

        <h3>Rust based Vulnerability Scanner</h3>
        <p>Automated scripts to detect vulnerabilities of computers in server - client architecture. Rust improves speed and performance and also provides much necessary Low level Access. eBPF for monitoring sys calls as well as enforcing the rules based on logs we get to detect containe related vulnrabilities in docker and Kubernetes.</p>

        <h3>Gen AI remote Sensing</h3>
        <p>using SAR images to perform various tasks like crop classification, </p>
