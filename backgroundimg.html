                It starts with one, one thing, I don't know why
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try
                Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
                All I know, time is a valuable thing
                Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
                Watch it count down to the end of the day, the clock ticks life away
                It's so unreal, didn't look out below
                Watch the time go right out the window
                Tryna hold on, d-didn't even know
                I wasted it all just to watch you go
                I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
                What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                One thing, I don't know why
                It doesn't even matter how hard you try
                Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
                To remind myself how I tried so hard
                In spite of the way you were mockin' me
                Actin' like I was part of your property
                Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
                I'm surprised it got so far
                Things aren't the way they were before
                You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
                Not that you knew me back then, but it all comes back to me in the end
                You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
                What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I've put my trust in you
                Pushed as far as I can go
                For all this, there's only one thing you should know
                I've put my trust in you
                Pushed as far as I can go
                For all this, there's only one thing you should know
                I tried so hard and got so far
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter
                I had to fall to lose it all
                But in the end, it doesn't even matter

                Napoleon Bonaparte[b] (born Napoleone Buonaparte;[1][c] 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a French general and statesman who rose to prominence during the 
                French Revolution and led a series of military campaigns across Europe during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1796 to 1815. He led the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then ruled the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1814, and briefly again in 1815.
                Born on the island of Corsica to a family of Italian origin, Napoleon moved to mainland France in 1779 and was commissioned as an officer in the French Royal Army in 1785.
                He supported the French Revolution in 1789, and promoted its cause in Corsica. He rose rapidly through the ranks after winning the siege of Toulon in 1793 and defeating royalist insurgents in Paris on 13 Vendémiaire in 1795. 
                In 1796, Napoleon commanded a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies in the War of the First Coalition, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero.
                 He led an invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798 which served as a springboard to political power. In November 1799, Napoleon engineered the Coup of 18 Brumaire against the Directory, and became First Consul of the Republic. He won the Battle of Marengo in 1800, which secured France's victory in the War of the Second Coalition, and in 1803 sold the territory of Louisiana to the United States. In December 1804, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French, further expanding his power.
